A Shiny App to create Gantt Charts by [Anthony A. Boyles](http://anthony.boyles.cc)

Gantt Chart code adapted from [this post](https://stats.andrewheiss.com/misc/gantt.html) by Andrew Heiss

## How do I get this thing running?

*Note*: You're probably only going to be able to use this if you're already an R user. Getting an R environment set up is complexity that's far outside the scope of this project. If you can't use R, just go to https://aaboyles.shinyapps.io/shinyganttcharts/ If you CAN use R, please do, as I'm not paying for shinyapps.io hosting and the free tier runs out really, really quickly.

You're going to need an R environment with Shiny, tidyverse, lubridate, and scales installed. If you don't have these, run this:

```r
install.packages(c('shiny', 'tidyverse', 'lubridate', 'scales', 'readxl', 'rhandsontable'))
```

In R, run the following:

```r
library(shiny)
runGitHub('ShinyGanttCharts', 'aaboyles')
```

That should launch the Shiny app.

## OK, so how do I use it?

First, you're going to need a **schedule file**. Basically, we need the data to create the Gantt chart in a well-structured format. That format is:

|Start|End|Project|Task|
| --- | - | ----- | -- |
|2015-11-15|2015-11-20|Data collection|Use IssueCrawler to expand lists|
|2015-11-21|2015-11-25|Data collection|Complete INGO databases|
|2015-11-16|2015-12-15|Data collection|Find all INGO legislation|

Some things to note:
* There are four headers, which are: `Start`, `End`, `Project`, and `Task`. They are all mandatory and case sensitive. Additional columns will be ignored.
* `Start` and `End` are dates. Furthermore, they're [ISO-8601 compliant dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (YYYY-MM-DD). This app **might** work with your date formats, but I don't guarantee it. If you're getting errors using other date formats, use your spreadsheet program to "Format Data" (or whatever) as `YYYY-MM-DD` date format.

If you just want to try it, **[Download a Demo File](https://github.com/aaboyles/ShinyGanttCharts/blob/master/demo.csv)**.

## What if I don't want to do that?

The App launches with a blank dataset by default. You can right-click on the table and click "Add Row Below" for each task that you want to plot on your chart. Each new row can be edited in-place on that table. It's a bit laborious, but fool-proof (inasmuch as it forces you to create well-formatted data).

## OK, so where's the chart?

Click on the "Gantt" Tab, next to "Table". There you go.

## Hey, could you...

Let me stop you right there. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/AABoyles/ShinyGanttCharts/issues/new) to request your fancy new feature or report that terrible bug.
